# Phase-3-Week-1-Toy-Problems-

## Description
This repository contains a collection of toy problems that are worked out in three sets of program:
### 1. Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
This program is set to convert 12-hour time to 24-hour time, i.e "10:45am" or "11:15pm" to "1045hr" or "2315hr",
### 2. Two numbers are positive.
the second program will check between three integers a, b and c, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise,
### 3. Consonant value
This program takes in a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, returns the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.
